                    <h5>All you need to know</h5>
                    <p>Born and raised in Northwest Ohio, but got to Texas as soon as I could! I moved down to texas when I was 20 and have loved it ever since. I persued a degree in Art Education from Texas State University and graduated in 2012. I have been teaching Middle School Art for the past 6 years, and yes it is as crazy as it sounds. I have 2 dogs and and an amazing husband of 2 years.</p>

                    <h2>What's it like to be an Art Teacher</h2>
                    <h5>A day in the life...</h5>
                    <p>The most exciting part of my day is that every day is different! You also never know what is going to come out of a students mouth at any given time. Sometimes it's the sweetest thing and other times it's like oh man we're screwed. I teach 4 different preps which means that I have to plan for 4 different classes every day and they never do the same thing. It can be very stressful at times but it always keeps me on my feet and ready for anything.</p>

                    <p>Not only am I an art educator but I am also an artist! Here Is part of my set up for East Austin Studio Tour! Currently I love working on mixed-media projects. I start off with doing an abstract blob in watercolour, then I go back and illustrate on top of that blob some characters I like sketching. I finish the product by colouring everything with alcohol markers and finally outline everything in my favorite black Micron pens.</p>
